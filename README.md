<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/OsamaBsharat/Welcome-signin-signup-screen-flutter/blob/main/UI.png?raw=true" alt="project-image"></p>

<p id="description">We craft three adaptive screens starting with an initial welcome screen that greets users upon opening the app. Users are presented with two choices: to log in by tapping the login button seamlessly transitioning to the login screen or to sign up by selecting the signup button leading them to the signup screen. These screens are meticulously designed to ensure optimal performance across Android iOS Web and Desktop platforms</p>
